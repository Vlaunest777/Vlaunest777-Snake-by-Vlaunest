The rules of the game:

The player controls a snake that collects objects on the field;

snake turns are possible by 90 degrees;

at each launch, the snake appears in a random place on the playing field;

each collected object increases the length of the snake by one block;

a snake's collision with its body or the boundary of the playing field leads to a loss;

The player needs to hold out as long as possible and collect as many objects as possible.
